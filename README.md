# Amazon Marketing Cloud Query Library

An open-source collection of battle-tested AMC SQL queries to accelerate your Amazon advertising analytics.

## 🎯 Why This Repository?

Amazon Marketing Cloud is powerful but underutilized. We're changing that by sharing production-ready queries that have driven real results for brands on Amazon.

**Built by practitioners, for practitioners** - These aren't theoretical examples. Every query here has been refined through real-world use at [e-Comas](https://e-comas.com).

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Browse queries by category in the `/queries` folder
2. Copy the SQL you need
3. Run in your AMC environment or test in the sandbox

Each query is tested and should work.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Whether you've optimized one of our queries or have new use cases to share, please open a PR.
